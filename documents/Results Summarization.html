## Introduction

This document will summarize the results of a gabi analysis of Padilla lab ZFpmr behavioral assays of DNT60 chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity.

This document will summarize...

* Activity by endpoint (hitcall > 0.8 implies activity)
  + number of chemicals active per endpoint
  + group chemicals by which endpoint they are found active in
* Activity by experimental period
  + activity profiles of chemicals by experimental periods
  + groups of chemicals sharing the same activity profile
  + number of chemicals found active in each experimental period (Freeze, Light, Startle, Dark)
* activity by chemical
  + for each chemical list their endpoint activity profile
  + number of endpoints a chemical was active in
  + group chemicals that share endpoint-activity profiles
* obtain BMD ranges
  + for all chemicals
  + for only chemicals found active in at least one endpoint
  
## Activity by Endpoint

### Count Hits per Endpoint
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](figure/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

### List Chemicals Active per Endpoint

```
## Error in lapply(hit.e.grps, paste, collapse = ", "): object 'hit.e.grps' not found
```

## Activity by Experimental Period

### Number of Chemicals Active per Experimental Period

Activity in an experimental period is defined as having at least one hitcall > 0.8 in an endpoint that describes that experimental period.

### List Chemicals Activity Profiles in Terms of Experimental Period

1 indicates activity in a period and 0 indicates inactivity.
