To run DNT60 pipelining, scripts should be run in order

data upload.R -> endpoint creation.R -> row creation.R -> tcplfitter.R -> heatmaps.R -> Consolidate DNT60 Analysis Results.R


#### data upload.R

Takes raw data file from Padilla lab and formats as lmr0 format. To see lmr0 format described in more detail see documentation for gabi::as_mc0.

#### endpoint creation.R

Takes lmr0 formatted table, calculates endpoint values using gabi functions, and formats this data in mc0 level tables. Also applies transformation procedure (Box-Cox) to mc0 data. To see detailed description of mc0 level datasets in this context see gabi::as_mc0 documentation.

#### row creation.R

Takes mc0 level datasets and formats data for exposures into tcplFit2 row objects. See tcplFit2 and gabi::as_row documentation to see better description of row objects.

#### tcplfitter.R

Applies tcplFit2 curve-fitting software to row objects. Summaries and figures from curve-fitting are saved in a nested list object.

#### heatmaps.R

Creates BMC heatmap for results from curve-fitting of DNT60 data. May be different than heatmap used in Manuscript related to this work. See ResDNT/Manuscript for the most updated heatmap.

#### Consolidate DNT60 Analysis Results.R

Saves DNT60 tcplFit2 summaries in a large table. Also saves graphics produced by curve-fitting.
